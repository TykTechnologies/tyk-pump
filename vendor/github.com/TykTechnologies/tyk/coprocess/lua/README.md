# Coprocess (Lua)

This feature makes it possible to write Tyk middleware using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

The requirement is to have [lua-cjson](http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson.php) installed, an easier way of getting it is by using `luarocks`:

```
% luarocks install lua-cjson
```
